**Project short description**  
This project demonstrates **serverless web hosting on AWS**, leveraging fully managed cloud services to build a scalable, cost-effective, and highly available web application without traditional server management.

- **Amazon Route 53** â€” Domain registration & DNS management to route traffic to the application.  
- **Amazon CloudFront** â€” Global CDN to deliver static and dynamic content with low latency.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€” Serverless compute for backend logic and APIs (no servers to manage).  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** â€” NoSQL database for fast, scalable data storage with automatic scaling.

## 2. Features

- âœ… Custom domain & DNS management with **Route 53**  
- âœ… Global content delivery using **CloudFront** (caching, HTTPS)  
- âœ… Serverless backend with **Lambda** (event-driven functions / API endpoints)  
- âœ… Persistent, low-latency storage with **DynamoDB**  
- âœ… Reduced operational overhead â€” fully managed services  
- âœ… Scalable and cost-optimized architecture  
- ðŸ”§ Add any extra features you implemented (authentication, logging, monitoring, CI/CD, etc.)
